# WoolWarsExtras

Wool Wars Extras is a Chat Triggers module designed to improve the playing experience of Hypixel Wool Wars and offer a variety of useful Quality-Of-Life features. When installing the mod, your first time running with the module should give you a help message. If it does not, run /ww to open the GUI where most things are also explained.

To install, download the zip and drag the WoolWarsExtras folder into .minecraft/config/Chattriggers/modules folder. Make sure you do not drag over the README.md, just the entire module folder. For any support dm me @encodey#0050 on discord or join https://discord.gg/TU2Prz8N8U
